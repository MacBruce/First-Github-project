            <p>We also love to make sure our customers stay well informed and well groomed. Maclaren started this company
            in 2016 with a goal of providing the best products on the market, that are both high quality and keep a low 
            impact on the enviroment. By choosing to sell clothing using the crowdfunding market, it allows us to keep our 
            workers well paid, reduces wast and lets us keep a good eye on quality control. We pride ourself as being the only
            sustainable suit company on the market thus far.</p>
